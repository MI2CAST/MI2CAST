The Minimum Information about a Molecular Interaction Causal Statement (MI2CAST)

This repository is a guideline providing a checklist of terms to depict causal statements in Molecular Biology.

## Introduction
A causal statement is defined as an interaction between biological material entities (gene, protein, etc) where a source entity regulates the activity or the quantity of a target entity.

This repository is a community effort to homogeneise and categorise information to depict about causal relationships. We define terms and ontologies are suggested for each term.

## Documentation
Go to the [MI2CAST guideline](docs/MI2CAST_guideline.md).

## Examples
* [E2F8 (transcription factor) regulation of CCNE1 (target gene) causal statement](examples/TF-TG.md),
* [Protein kinase A catalytic subunit regulation](examples/PKA_regulation.md)
