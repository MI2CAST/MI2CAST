Minimum Information about a Causal Statement - Repository defining concepts to depict causal statements in Systems and Molecular Biology

## Introduction
A causal statement is defined as an interaction between biological entities (gene, protein, etc) where a source entity regulates the activity of the target entity.

This repository is a community effort to homogeneise and categorise information to depict when it comes to causal statements. We define terms and ontologies are suggested for each term.
