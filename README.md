# MI2CAST
The Minimum Information about a Molecular Interaction Causal Statement (MI2CAST)

This repository contains the guidelines defined for the curation of causal statements in molecular interactions.

## Introduction
A causal statement is defined as an interaction between biological material entities (gene, protein, etc) where a source entity regulates the activity or the quantity of a target entity.

This repository is a community effort to homogenize and categorize information to depict about causal relationships. Terms are defined and ontologies/controlled vocabularies to use are suggested for each term.

## Documentation
Access to the [MI2CAST guidelines](docs/MI2CAST_guideline.md).

## Concrete examples
* [E2F8 (transcription factor) regulation of CCNE1 (target gene) causal statement](examples/TF-TG.md),
* [Protein kinase A catalytic subunit regulation](examples/PKA_regulation.md)
