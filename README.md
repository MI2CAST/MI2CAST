Minimum Information about a Causal Statements - Repository defining mandatory concepts to depict causal statements in Systems Biology

## Introduction
A causal statement is a binary interaction between two biological entities (gene, protein, etc) where the source entity regulates the activity of the target entity.

This repository is a community effort to homogeneise the representation of causal statements by setting up mandatory terms to provide and suggesting ontologies to use for each term.
