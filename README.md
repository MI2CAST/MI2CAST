The Minimum Information about a Causal Statement

This repository is a guideline providing a checklist of required terms to depict causal statements in Systems and Molecular Biology.

## Introduction
A causal statement is defined as an interaction between biological entities (gene, protein, etc) where a source entity regulates the activity or the quantity of a target entity.

This repository is a community effort to homogeneise and categorise information to depict about causal relationships. We define terms and, ontologies are suggested for each term.
