The Minimum Information about a Molecular Interaction Causal Statement (MI2CAST)

This repository is a guideline providing a checklist of terms to depict causal statements in Molecular Biology.

## Introduction
A causal statement is defined as an interaction between biological material entities (gene, protein, etc) where a source entity regulates the activity or the quantity of a target entity.

This repository is a community effort to homogeneise and categorise information to depict about causal relationships. We define terms and ontologies are suggested for each term.
